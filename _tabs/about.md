## ðŸ™‚ Hi,

I am an engineer with expertise in Kubernetes, Docker, Linux, Python, and AWS. With a strong foundation in these technologies, I excel at designing and deploying scalable and efficient solutions. In my free time, I cherish spending quality moments with my family & friends, especially my daughter, who brings joy and balance to my life. Balancing professional excellence with personal fulfillment, I find great satisfaction in both my technical achievements and my role as a dedicated family man.
